Intent Detection from Comments in Collaborative Documents

This projectfocuses on the detection of intent from comments made in collaborative documents. Our objective is to apply various machine learning models to analyze and predict the intent behind user comments efficiently, thus enhancing collaborative efforts and document management.


**Project Structure:**

**Checkpoint 1**: Initiation of the project, setting up the initial dataset, and conducting preliminary exploratory data analysis.

**Checkpoint 2**: Implementation of Logistic Regression to classify intents and evaluation of its performance.

**Checkpoint 3**: Exploration of alternative models including Multinomial Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine to compare and determine the best fit based on error rates and accuracy.


**Files:**

Checkpoint1_ADS.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing initial data analysis and setup.

CMCheckpoint2.ipynb: Contains additional code and tests conducted in checkpoint 2 and 3.

labeled_comments.csv: Dataset used for training and testing models.


**Installation and Usage:**

Clone this repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/ApurvaR1/intent-detection-collab-comments.git

Install the required libraries:

bash

Copy code

pip install -r requirements.txt

Navigate to the notebook and follow the instructions within for execution and further exploration.


**Results Summary:**

Our explorations through various models have given us insights into the complexities of intent detection in text data. Logistic Regression provided a baseline with around 67% accuracy, while more complex models like Random Forest and SVM offered different perspectives on error rates and data fitting.


**Conclusion:**

The project showcases the application of machine learning to real-world text data, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in intent detection. Further improvements could involve deeper feature engineering, experimenting with more advanced models, and expanding the dataset for better generalization.
